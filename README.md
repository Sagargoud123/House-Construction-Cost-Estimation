# House-Construction-Cost-Estimation
This Streamlit app estimates house construction cost and completion time based on user inputs like area, floors, materials, and labor efficiency. It calculates material &amp; labor costs, predicts total days including curing/buffer time, and visualizes the cost distribution using a pie chart.
This project is a Streamlit-based web application that estimates house construction cost and completion time using basic civil engineering assumptions, material rates, and labor efficiency.
The app helps users understand material requirements, labor cost, total project cost, and visually shows cost distribution using a pie chart.
